baposter Portrait Poster

Original description:
This poster template neatly divides content into separate boxes with clear headings in each one. The portrait layout features a small side column for study details and a larger column to show off results obtained from the research. The larger column can be optionally divided into two columns to squeeze more information into the poster. The default colors of the template are in the blue spectrum but can be easily changed within the template. Examples of a table, figure, equation, list and bibliography are present in the template to provide a starting point for any requirement you may have for your own poster.
